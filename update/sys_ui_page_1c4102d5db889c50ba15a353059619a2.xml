	<h1>DataSilos</h1>
	<p>Welcome to DataSilos.<!-- - created and maintained by&#160;<a href="mailto:sascha.wildgrube@servicenow.com">Sascha Wildgrube</a>.--></p>
	<p>The DataSilos application helps to separate data between different organisational units - so called&#160;<b>data silos</b>.</p>
	<p>In contrast to domain separation DataSilos allows the exchange of data (in form of individual records) between data silos and makes them visible to users on a need-to-know basis.</p>
	<h2>Use DataSilos if</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Domain Separation is too strict</li>
		<li>Domain Separation is already implemented for a different purpose and more detailed visibilty rules must be enforced WITHIN a domain</li> 
		<li>There is a certain level of collaboration taking place between organizational units</li>
		<li>Visibility of individual records can be defined by a user's assignment to groups</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Do NOT use DataSilos if</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>The different organizational units shall NEVER exchange any records (in that case Domain Separation may be considered)</li>
		<li>Visibility of data should be controlled by specific user roles</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h2>Supported processes</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Incident</li>
		<li>Change Request</li>
		<!--<li>Problem</li>-->
		<!--<li>Requests</li>-->
	</ol>
	
	<h2>How DataSilos controls record visibility</h2>
	<p>Users are members of groups. Groups can be associated to data silos by a silo manager. Each association between a group and a data silo has a type. Whether an individual user can see a record of a supported process depends on the type of their group's association with a silo.</p>
	<p><b>Member:</b>&#160;Users in groups that are associated to a silo as type "Member" can only see those records that are or were directly assigned to that group and they see all records that have been created by a member of the same group.</p>
	<p><b>Fulfiller:</b>&#160;Users in groups that are associated to a silo as type "Fulfiller" can see all records that have been created by users in all groups that are associated to the same silo. And they see all records that have ever been assigned directly assigned to their group. As a result fulfillers have an overview of all work that originates from the same silo. However fulfillers do not see any records that have been created in another silo and assigned to another team within the fulfiller's silo.</p>
	<p><b>Supervisor:</b>&#160;Users in groups that are associated to a silo as type "Supervisor" can see all records that have been created by users in all groups that are associated to the same silo. They see all records that have ever been assigned to any group of the same silo. As a result supervisors have an overview of all work originating and conducted in their silos. This includes all records that have been created in other silos and that have been assigned to the supervisor's silo.</p>

	<h2>System Requirements</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Madrid or later</li>
		<li>DevTools</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h2>Requirement analysis</h2>
	<p>Please consider the following aspects when preparing the implementation of DataSilos as its activation may have wide-spread implications on processes, integrations and various stakeholders:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Who is responsible to define the data silos and can provide the mapping to groups? In large organizations this might be a challenging task - especially if there are multiple systems of record from which organization data is retrieved and imported into the ServiceNow instance.</li>
		<li>Consider all integrations! The technical users used for integrations will also be affected by access restrictions applies by DataSilos.</li>
		<li>How will external suppliers and vendors be affected? The specific rights and roles of users associated to external suppliers and vendors should be considered.</li>
	</ol>
	
	<h2>Roles</h2>
	<p>DataSilos supports the following roles:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>x_snc_datasilos.admin:</b>&#160;A user that has access to all DataSilo administration and configuration modules. Includes the&#160;<b>x_snc_datasilos.manager</b>&#160;role.</li>
		<li><b>x_snc_datasilos.manager:</b>&#160;A user that can configure data silos and assign groups to data silos.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h2>Installation guide</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Install the DataSilos application. If you see this installation guide within the ServiceNow instance, you did this already.</li>
		<li>Assign the x_snc_datasilos.manager role to users.</li>
		<li>As a data silos manager go to the "Data Silos" module and configure all data silos. Add the corresponding groups to each data silo. Groups associated to a data silo are either&#160;<b>Member</b>,&#160;<b>Fulfiller</b>&#160;or&#160;<b>Supervisor</b>&#160;groups.</li>
		<li>Prepare support for incidents:</li>
		<ol>
			<li>Switch to the GLOBAL scope.</li>

			<pre>
Name: DataSilos - Incident
When: before
Insert: true
Update: true
Query: true
			</pre>
			<li>Add the following script:</li>
			<pre>
(function executeRule(current, previous /*null when async*/) {
	x_snc_datasilos.ExecuteBusinessRule(current, previous);
})(current, previous);

			</pre>
			<li>Verify you are still in GLOBAL scope</li>
			<li>Add a new business rule for the 'incident_task' table.</li>
			<li>Configure the business rule as follows:</li>
			<pre>
Name: DataSilos - Incident Task
When: before
Insert: true
Update: true
Query: true
			</pre>
			<li>Add the following script:</li>
			<pre>
(function executeRule(current, previous /*null when async*/) {
	x_snc_datasilos.ExecuteBusinessRule(current, previous);
})(current, previous);
			</pre>
			<li>Go to the "Business Rules" module and verify the new business rule is active and in the global scope.</li>

	<h2>FAQ</h2>
	<h3>What happens if a user is not associated to any group?</h3>
	<p>The user will not see any records unless the user has the admin role.</p>
	<h3>What happens if a record is not associated to any group?</h3>
	<p>No user - except admins - will see this record.</p>
	<h3>How does it work?</h3>
	<p>DataSilos adds a new field to all relevant tables that contains a whitelist of groups. A user that is at least member of one of these whitelisted groups may see the record. Business rules in the global scope will alter the query and act on inserts and updates to control visibility and extend the whitelist where appropriate.</p>
	
	<h2>Developer guide</h2>
	<p>When extending the scope of the DataSilos application the following steps should be considered:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Identify the affected tables</li>
		<li>Add the whitelist field to all affected tables:</li>
			<pre>
Type: List
Column label: DataSilos Group Whitelist
Column name: x_snc_datasilos_group_whitelist
Attributes: edge_encryption_enabled=true,no_sort=true,slushbucket_ref_no_expand=true
Reference: Group
Reference cascade rule: None (not "--None--"!)
			</pre>
		<li>Add create, write and delete Access Controls to the table DataSilos whitelist columns for all affected tables:</li>
<pre>
Name: DataSilos Group Whitelist
Requires role: x_snc_datasilos.datasilos_manager 
</pre>
		<li>Extend the IsTableMainRecord script include to support the table of the main records (e.g. incident, change_request, etc.).</li>
		<li>Extend the IsTableRelatedRecord script include to support the tables of related records (e.g. tasks).</li>
		<li>Extend the GetParentRecord script include to support the identification of parent records of related records (e.g. to get the incident from an incident task)</li>
		<li>Extend the GetRelatedRecords script include to support the identification of related records of a main record (e.g. to get the incident_tasks from an incident)</li>
		<li>Switch to global scope and add corresponding business rules for all affected tables</li>
		<li>Switch back to DataSilos scope</li>
		<li>Create ATF tests. The following tests can be used as templates:</li>
			<pre>
DataSilos - Incident
DataSilos - Incident - Cross-silo
DataSilos - Incident Task
DataSilos - Incident Task - Cross-silo
			</pre>
		<li>Update THIS documentation</li>
